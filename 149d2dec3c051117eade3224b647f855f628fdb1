      "message": "The new image is ~150MB bigger than before.\n\nWhat we need to consider:\n- the packaged java version is 5 generation newer (13 vs. 1.8), maybe it has better memory/heap/GC handling\n- I guess they have a good reason to package a specific version/edition of java, it is more tested together\n- I don\u0027t know whether the packaged java is customized in any way (custom code or config files) to optimize it for ES or a stock java is used\n- openjdk 1.8.0 is officially supported by ES, though\n\nWhat is your opinion?",
